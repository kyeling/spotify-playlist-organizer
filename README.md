# spotify-playlist-organizer

## How to use
1. Create a python virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
2. Activate the virutal environment by running `source venv/Scripts/activate` (Bash) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (powershell).
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script with `python organize-playlist.py <playlist name>`. (Note: running the script for the first time will require one-time authentication.)
5. When finished, run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment.

## Custom sorting algorithms
These can be found in 'util.py', and likewise, new sorting keys can be defined in this file as well.
